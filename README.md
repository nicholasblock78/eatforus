# Eat for Us

I'm very excited to be able to start working on this sustainable food blog. I've lost over 120 pounds and I can't wait to pour what I've learned into this site. Hopefully, this site will prove invaluable to others trying to achieve the same feat as me or simply make a difference in our world.
